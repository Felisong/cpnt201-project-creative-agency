This template was taken from [This site](https://play.teleporthq.io) Specifically, {this one}(https://play.teleporthq.io/projects/marketing-event-page-xb9o59/editor/687b77c3-cc11-499e-8c2e-32216e1beed0)

I used some images from [this site](https://www.freepik.com)

This is what I have modified to make this.

### Cloning

1. Open Terminal or Git Bash:

On Windows, you can use Git Bash or Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux, use the Terminal application.

Navigate to Your Desired Directory:

Use the cd command to change to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:
bash

```
cd path/to/your/directory
```

2. Get the Repository URL:

Go to the repository page on GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other Git hosting service.

Look for a button labeled Code (on GitHub) or Clone (on Bitbucket). Copy the URL provided (either HTTPS or SSH format).
Run the Clone Command:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

3. Change into the Cloned Directory:

After cloning, navigate into the new directory that was created:

cd repository

4. Start Working:
   You can now start editing files, committing changes, and pushing updates back to the remote repository.

### Forking the Repository

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository you want to fork.

2. In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the "Fork" button.

3. GitHub will process your request for a few seconds. You'll see a message like "Forking [repository name]..."

4. Once complete, you'll be redirected to your new forked repository under your GitHub account.

Then Clone the Repository.
